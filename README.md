# Steps
A program I wrote to log the number of steps taken each day for a week. It tells you whether you met the step goal and gives the total number of steps for the week,
how many days that week you met the goal of steps taken, the average number of steps taken per day, the number of miles walked that week based on the average 
person's step in inches, and how many more miles you would have to walk to reach your destination that you are asked to input.
